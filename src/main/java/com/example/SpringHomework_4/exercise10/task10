Create a project based on Spring Boot using:

    spring-boot-starter-data-jpa
    lombok
    h2

Create the Book entity. Rows should be kept in the books table. This entity should have an automatically generated identifier of type Long and columns such as:

    title
    author
    ISBN
    pagesNum

Create a JPA repository with the query:

    returning all books with a specific title
    returning the book after ISBN
    returning the author's book on a specific ISBN
    returning the 3 thickest books by a given author (the one with the most pages should be the first, the last one with the least)
    that returns all books whose names begin with a particular String
    returning all books with pages between the two values

These queries should be constructed using the appropriate names methods. In addition, implement a method called findWherePagesNumIsGreaterThanX and one argument of typeInteger that returns all books that have at least as many pages as the input argument is.
